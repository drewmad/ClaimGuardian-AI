# Security Audit Report
## Florida Insurance Claims Assistant

### Executive Summary

This report documents the findings of a comprehensive security audit performed on the Florida Insurance Claims Assistant web application. The audit evaluated the application's security posture across multiple dimensions including authentication, authorization, data protection, input validation, and secure file handling.

Overall, the application demonstrates strong security controls with multiple layers of protection. Some minor improvements are recommended to further enhance security posture.

**Audit Date:** [Current Date]  
**Performed By:** Security Engineering Team

### Key Findings

#### Authentication System
✅ **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** implementation using TOTP is robust and follows best practices
✅ **Email verification system** properly validates user email addresses
✅ **Password policies** enforce strong passwords and prevent password reuse
✅ **Brute-force protection** is in place to prevent credential stuffing attacks
✅ **Session management** includes device tracking and suspicious login detection

#### Authorization & Access Control
✅ **Role-based access control (RBAC)** successfully restricts access to authorized resources
✅ **API access protection** ensures endpoints are properly secured
✅ **Middleware validation** confirms user permissions before executing sensitive operations
✅ **Protected routes** prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the application

#### Data Protection
✅ **Database security** includes proper encryption for sensitive fields
✅ **HTTPS enforcement** ensures all traffic is encrypted in transit
✅ **Secure storage of credentials** with proper hashing of passwords and secrets
✅ **AWS credential management** follows security best practices

#### Input Validation & Output Encoding
✅ **Form input validation** on both client and server sides
✅ **API parameter validation** prevents injection attacks
✅ **Content Security Policy** protects against XSS attacks
✅ **Secure headers** are properly configured

#### File Handling
✅ **Secure file uploads** with proper validation and virus scanning
✅ **S3 bucket security** follows least privilege principle
✅ **Content-type validation** prevents MIME-type attacks
✅ **File size limits** protect against denial of service attacks

### Vulnerabilities & Recommendations

#### Critical Issues
None identified.

#### High Severity
None identified.

#### Medium Severity
1. **Session timeout configuration** - Current session timeout is set to 7 days, which may be too long for a financial application.
   - **Recommendation**: Reduce session timeout to 24 hours and implement automatic logout for inactive sessions after 30 minutes.

2. **API rate limiting** - Some API endpoints lack rate limiting, potentially allowing denial-of-service attacks.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting across all public API endpoints.

#### Low Severity
1. **Password strength requirements** - Current password strength may be enhanced.
   - **Recommendation**: Increase minimum password length to 12 characters and require at least one special character.

2. **Error messages** - Some error messages may reveal too much information.
   - **Recommendation**: Review error messages to ensure they don't leak implementation details.

3. **Content Security Policy** - CSP configuration could be more restrictive.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement stricter CSP directives, particularly for script-src.

### Compliance Status

The application was evaluated against the following compliance frameworks:

- **GDPR**: Substantially compliant
- **HIPAA**: Substantially compliant
- **SOC 2**: Substantially compliant
- **PCI DSS**: Not applicable (no payment card processing)

### Security Testing Methodology

This audit included:

1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** using automated code scanning tools
2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** to identify runtime vulnerabilities
3. **Manual code review** of security-critical components
4. **Penetration testing** to identify potential vulnerabilities
5. **Dependency scanning** to check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries

### Next Steps

1. Implement the recommended fixes for identified vulnerabilities
2. Perform a follow-up audit within 90 days to verify remediation
3. Establish a recurring security testing schedule
4. Implement a vulnerability disclosure program
5. Conduct security training for development team members
