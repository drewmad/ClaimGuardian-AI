## Dependencies

- Iteration 1 must be completed before starting Iteration 2
- Authentication (1.4) is required before implementing any protected features
- Database schema updates (2.1, 2.2, 3.3) should be coordinated to minimize migrations
- AWS S3 integration (3.1) is required before document upload (3.2)
- Document Management (Iteration 3) should be completed before Document Analysis (Iteration 4)
- AWS Rekognition integration (4.1) is required for text extraction (4.2)

## Getting Started

To start implementation, follow these steps:
1. Complete the tasks in Iteration 1.1 and 1.2
2. Implement the shared UI components (1.3)
3. Set up authentication (1.4)
4. Continue with subsequent iterations based on priority
